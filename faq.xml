* We start with a FAQS element
*
* A master container element was needed, and 'faqs' seemed as good as anything

	* Defines a section to store related questions/answer pairs.

	* The 'title' attribute names your section and will be displayed in the
	* generated html.

		* FAQ
		*
		* Each question/answer pair is stored within a 'faq' element
		* This is basically a convenient container element so that we can
		* xpath our way to the question/answer pairs.

		* You can define as many question/answer pairs as you desire.

			******************************************************************
			* QUESTION
			*
			* Stores the question portion of this question/answer pair.
			*
			* This is generally expected to contain plain text (no HTML) and
			* be relatively short.
			*
			* You can use any amount of whitespace you desire, as the question
			* text will be passed through the 'inTrim' filter before before
			* it is output.
			*
			* The filter removes all leading and trailing whitespace, and also
			* replaces all inner occurrences of one or more whitespace
			* characters with a single space (' ') character.

				Am I the first FAQ queston?

			<!--
			******************************************************************
			* Stores the answer portion of this question/answer pair.
			*
			* This can contain text, HTML, XHTML, etc - Pretty much anything.
			* The '<![CDATA[' wrapper ensures that you can enter any text you
			* desire. I strongly recommend that you not remove it.
			*
			* The text will be wrapped in a <div> element in the output file.
			*
			* You can use any amount of whitespace you desire, as the answer
			* text will be passed through the 'trim' block filter before it is
			* output.
			*
			* The filter will 'trim' leading and trailing whitespace from
			* the entire block of text, and will also trim each line of text.
			*
			* A (current) side effect of this is that any indentation you add
			* to the text (to make it look pretty in this file) will be lossed
			* in the generated output.
